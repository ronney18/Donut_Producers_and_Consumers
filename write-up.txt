My degree of sucess for this assignment is an 80%. I got all my producers and consumers
to work properly. Unfortunately, I am having problems in submitting the first 10
dozens of donuts from any of the 5 consumers to a file. If I try to write these in
a file, my program also writes the entire output from the console to the file as
well which is way more than what I need specifically.

I experimented with my program for a while. I started my program with 30 producers
and 50 consumers with a QUEUE size of 200 collecting 200 dozens. When I ran my 
program for 5 loops a couple of times, I relatively get 3-4 deadlocks out of 5 
loops which means I get 1-2 successful runs. I found out that the probability 
of getting a deadlock with this QUEUE size is high around 80% of the time.

I then brought the QUEUE size up to 600 and my probability of getting deadlock
went down to 50%. I believe that this is the 50% mark because when I ran my program
a couple of times again. I get 2-3 dealocks out of 5 loops. At this size, it is
equally likely to get deadlock.

I then brought my QUEUE size up to 1000 and my probability of getting deadlock
went down to 10% of the time. I have learned that when my QUEUE size increases
my chances of getting deadlock decreases because the more space the producer
has, the more choices the consumers has in collecting donuts.

The distribution of this graph over the depth of the QUEUE is almost linear
with a slight curve. I consider using linear regression for an estimate of the
probability.

I then took my 600 QUEUE size, which is my 50% chance of getting deadlock, and 
experimented with the changes of number of dozens. I brought my number of dozens 
down to 100 and when I ran my program again for 5 loops, I got roughly 0-1 deadlock
out of the 5 loops. My probability of getting deadlock is 20% when collecting only
100 dozens.

I then brought my number of dozens up to 150 and I got roughly 1-2 deadlocks
out of 5 loops. I realized that my chances of getting deadlock went up to 30%.

I then changed my number of dozens up to 250 and my probability of getting deadlock
went up to 75% because I was getting 3-4 deadlocks out of 5 loops in the shell run.
I then changed my number of dozens up to 300 and I was getting 4-5 deadlock out of
the 5 loops in which it went up to 85%.

I learned that when my maximum number of dozens increases, my probability of getting
deadlock increases because the more number of dozens increases, the more donuts the
consumer has to collect in order to be full with limited space for the producers
in which if the producers run out of space with no options left over for the consumers,
the consumers get left hanging in the program.
